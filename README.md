2.1 a)
(R\{-1},star) is an Abelian group .
 i tested closure, associativity , neutral and inverse element and commutativity (since an Abelian group is a commutative group)

b) x1= 1 and x2 = -3


2.4 matrix products . easy . just calculate the matrix products straightforward. possible iff (thats if and only if) the number of columns of A = number of rows of B .

2.5 Gaussian algorithm leads to a contradiction --> no solution

above was a

b) Gaussian algorithm leads to infinetely many solutions

2.6 Gaussian algorithm leads to infintely many solutions (we have one free parameter)

2.7 I derived a contradiction, so not possible

2.8 a ) inv(A) impossible, because it's a singular matrix

b) inv (A) =

\begin{bmatrix}
0& -1& 0& 1\\
-1 & 0& 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
+ row 1 1 1 -2

2.9 a) no b) yes c) no d) yes
2.10 a) linearly dependant

2.11 lamba1= -6, lambda2=3, lambda3=2
2.11 again through the Gauss algorithm
2.12 i took the standard basis of R^4
2.10 b) linearly indepedant, because row 3 implies lambda1=0
